# Tasks: Bluetooth Paired Device Discovery

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-gio-library-mac/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

<!--
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: The tasks below are SAMPLE TASKS for illustration purposes only.

  The /speckit.tasks command MUST replace these with actual tasks based on:
  - User stories from spec.md (with their priorities P1, P2, P3...)
  - Feature requirements from plan.md
  - Entities from data-model.md
  - Endpoints from contracts/

  Tasks MUST be organized by user story so each story can be:
  - Implemented independently
  - Tested independently
  - Delivered as an MVP increment

  DO NOT keep these sample tasks in the generated tasks.md file.
  ============================================================================

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T002 Initialize C++17 project with CMake build system
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure Google C++ Style Guide compliance tools (clang-format, cpplint)
- [ ] T004 [P] Setup cross-compilation environment for Linux ARM64
- [ ] T005 [P] Configure static analysis tools for C++17 code quality

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

Examples of foundational tasks (adjust based on your project):

- [ ] T006 Setup CMakeLists.txt for library and CLI builds
- [ ] T007 [P] Implement GIO D-Bus connection management class (internal resource management)
- [ ] T008 [P] Setup error handling and logging infrastructure
- [ ] T009 Create base data structures from data-model.md
- [ ] T010 Configure build targets: libble shared library and ble_paired CLI executable

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - 查询已配对蓝牙设备 (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: 实现核心蓝牙设备查询功能，提供基础的设备信息查询能力

**Independent Test**: 通过执行 CLI 程序并验证输出中是否包含正确的 MAC 地址格式来独立测试

### Tests for User Story 1 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️

**NOTE**: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation\*\*

- [ ] T011 [P] [US1] Contract test for bluetooth::get_paired_devices() in tests/contract/test_api_contract.cpp
- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Integration test for CLI tool in tests/integration/test_bluetooth_integration.cpp

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T013 [P] [US1] Create PairedBluetoothDevice struct in src/include/bluetooth/device_discovery.hpp
- [ ] T014 [P] [US1] Create DeviceQueryResult struct in src/include/bluetooth/device_discovery.hpp
- [ ] T015 [P] [US1] Implement MAC address validation function in src/lib/bluetooth/device_discovery.cpp
- [ ] T016 [P] [US1] Implement error code enumeration and handling in src/include/bluetooth/device_discovery.hpp
- [ ] T017 [US1] Implement core bluetooth::get_paired_devices() function in src/lib/bluetooth/device_discovery.cpp
- [ ] T018 [US1] Implement bluetooth::get_paired_devices_with_timeout() function in src/lib/bluetooth/device_discovery.cpp
- [ ] T019 [US1] Create CLI argument parsing in src/cli/ble_paired.cpp
- [ ] T020 [US1] Implement text output formatting in src/cli/ble_paired.cpp
- [ ] T021 [US1] Add error handling and user-friendly messages in src/cli/ble_paired.cpp
- [ ] T022 [US1] Add timeout handling in src/cli/ble_paired.cpp

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - 集成到其他应用程序 (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: 支持程序化访问，提高功能复用性

**Independent Test**: 通过编写测试程序调用函数并验证返回的 MAC 地址列表来独立测试

### Tests for User Story 2 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️

- [ ] T023 [P] [US2] Integration test for library usage scenarios in tests/integration/test_library_integration.cpp

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T024 [US2] Add comprehensive documentation and usage examples in README.md
- [ ] T025 [US2] Validate library ABI stability and compatibility
- [ ] T026 [US2] Create example integration programs in examples/
- [ ] T027 [US2] Optimize library for performance (memory usage, query time)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [ ] T028 [P] Documentation updates in docs/ and README.md
- [ ] T029 Code cleanup and refactoring following Google C++ Style Guide
- [ ] T030 Performance optimization across all stories
- [ ] T031 [P] Additional unit tests (if requested) in tests/unit/
- [ ] T032 Security hardening and input validation
- [ ] T033 Run quickstart.md validation and ensure all examples work

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on User Story 1 completion

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, User Story 1 can start
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (if tests requested):
Task: "Contract test for bluetooth::get_paired_devices() in tests/contract/test_api_contract.cpp"
Task: "Integration test for CLI tool in tests/integration/test_bluetooth_integration.cpp"

# Launch all data structures together:
Task: "Create PairedBluetoothDevice struct in src/include/bluetooth/device_discovery.hpp"
Task: "Create DeviceQueryResult struct in src/include/bluetooth/device_discovery.hpp"

# Launch core functions together:
Task: "Implement core bluetooth::get_paired_devices() function in src/lib/bluetooth/device_discovery.cpp"
Task: "Implement bluetooth::get_paired_devices_with_timeout() function in src/lib/bluetooth/device_discovery.cpp"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
